# cloudformation-kata
Repeatable learning sessions for mastering AWS CloudFormation

## Kata Concept
The idea of a kata is to repeat an action so often that it becomes automatic. 
This means that we repeat an exercise so often that we're able to complete it 
in minimal time with minimal assistance (from Google, etc.).

## CloudFormation
CloudFormation is a Infrastructure As Code (IAC) tool within Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Using CF we can build infrastucture, create users, deploy servers, and more.
